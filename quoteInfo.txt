Don't talk, just act. Don't say, just show. Don't promise, just prove.
Embrace your struggle. Fuel your hustle. Reach your dream.
You are capable of anything and everything. You just have to respect your goals so much that chasing them becomes your only choice.
Whenever you feel like giving up, think of all the people that would love to see you fail.
Always look forward, never look back, because your best days are ahead of you.
You're the key to everything. Trust the process, but also trust yourself.
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. -Rikki Rogers
Success is not achieved by winning all the time. Real success comes when we rise after we fall. -Muhammad Ali
Don't tell people your plans. Show them your results.
Success does not depend on your age, a degree, your wealth, or your IQ; it does depend on your belief in yourself and consistent action toward your goals.
